inside this read me we have 3 sets of game assignments (balls on a board, future space frogs & desert racer.)

balls on a board was our first assignment, this was to create 4 balls that move in unison around a checkard board. each ball has a different colour and when a certain button
pressed the balls would change colour in a clockwise potion. the game would also be paused etc


future space frogs was a driving game about squishing frogs, there are 4 frogs that spawn in a red cube, each frog would move out of the cube and you as the car needed to drive
into the frog and squish it. when 1 frog is kiled the next one is allowed to move, if any of the frogs get to the end (water) the game would end and you would lose


desert racer is a basic racing game. you would need to program the speed of the racer and all collisions of the track.
