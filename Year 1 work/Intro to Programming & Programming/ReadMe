both of these assignments are from my year 1 programming class

intro to programming.CS is a vending machine that uses the console. you select how much money goes in what you want to buy out of the selection and the change you get back etc

programming.cpp is a word check, very similar and simplifed to a spell check on word. it checks certain words and its letter count etc, this assignment i didnt completely finish
but did get enough for a first.
